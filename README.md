# üé¨ Hybrid Movie Recommender System

This project aims to build a hybrid movie recommendation system that combines both **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** and **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** techniques using the MovieLens dataset.

## Project Objective

The main goal is to provide better movie recommendations by:
- Understanding user behaviors and preferences,
- Identifying similar users and similar movies,
- Merging both approaches to improve recommendation accuracy.

## Dataset

The project uses the **MovieLens 20M Dataset**, which includes:

- `rating.csv`: Contains `userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, and `timestamp`.
- `movie.csv`: Contains `movieId`, `title`, and `genres`.

Make sure both files are located **in the same folder as the project file**, or update the path according to your setup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- cosine_similarity (from Scikit-learn)

## Main Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Filtering movies with very few ratings (rare movies)  
   - Creating a user-movie matrix for analysis

2. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**  
   - Calculating similarities between users  
   - Recommending movies that similar users liked

3. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**  
   - Identifying movies similar to the ones user has highly rated  
   - Calculating cosine similarity between items

4. **Hybrid Recommendation**  
   - Combining results from both techniques for stronger output
   
## How to Run

Install required libraries (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install pandas
```

Run the recommender system:

```bash
python hybrid_recommender_project.py
```


## üìå Sample Output

Example user-based recommendation:

```
